Compiling AntBots: 

type make in the src directory. The executable is placed
in the directory above src.

make clean - cleans up the object and executable files

make distrib - 	create a .tgz archive containing this file, Makefile, *.cpp, and *.h.
		the archive is saved with the version name taken from the 
		Makefile one directory above src.


Running AntBots:

Usage: ./antbots [gui|nogui] [comp|coop]

Usage: ./antbots run with no arguments defaults to gui and competition options

Version History:

Release 1.4:

1) Added comments for Colony::getFitness() and replaced the magic number 1280 with 
   the caclulated variable total_seeds_available.

2) Made GA::getAverageFitness() use the fitness function from Colony rather than the
 number of seeds collected.

3) Changes in header files cause a complete remake of the code.

Release 1.3: 

1) the number of seeds was being normalized by the number of interactions twice. Once in the evolve function and once in get fitness. I commented out the one in the evolve function.
2) There was a cosmetic bug in which the fitness, which is the fraction of seeds collected, was being divided by the wrong number of seeds.
3) I changed the thread scheduling scheme to increase performance. On the 8 core/hyperthread moon machines I have seen total run time decrease by 75% (from 90mins to 20 mins) and on my 4 core laptop by about 50% (20mins to 9 mins).
The output also shows per core progress.
4) Changed the libraries in the linker parameter in Makefile so it works under 64bit ubuntu.
